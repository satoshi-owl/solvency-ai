# APY Reality Check - Can We Deliver 6-9%?

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Question:** Is our 6-9% APY claim realistic and sustainable?

---

## Current Market Rates (Research)

### Kamino Finance USDC Lending
- **March 2025 data:** 4.42% APY
- **Source:** Exponential DeFi aggregator
- **Note:** Lower end, may vary by market conditions

### Marginfi USDC Lending
- **October 2025 review:** 5-10% APY range
- **Documentation example:** 8% APY for lenders (borrowers at 10%)
- **Source:** Marginfi docs, CoinCodeCap review
- **Note:** Higher end, depends on utilization

### Market Context
- **Conservative lending:** 4-6% APY (overcollateralized, low risk)
- **Moderate strategies:** 6-9% APY (balanced protocols, optimized)
- **Aggressive yields:** 10%+ APY (higher risk, leverage, newer protocols)

## Our Claims vs Reality

### What We're Promising
**"6-9% APY through conservative DeFi strategies (Kamino, Marginfi)"**

### Analysis

**Bottom range (6%):** ✅ **ACHIEVABLE**
- Marginfi at moderate utilization: 5-8% APY
- Kamino with optimized pools: 4-6% APY
- Blended strategy: Easily 6%+

**Mid-range (7-8%):** ✅ **REALISTIC**
- Marginfi during high demand: 8-10% APY
- Strategic allocation between protocols
- Rate shopping (move capital to higher yields)

**Top range (9%):** ⚠️ **STRETCH but POSSIBLE**
- Requires optimal market conditions
- High utilization on both protocols
- Active rebalancing
- May not be 100% sustainable year-round

---

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

### Conservative Scenario (Worst Case)
**4-6% APY**
- Kamino: 4% APY
- Marginfi: 5% APY
- Blended: 4.5% APY
- **Status:** Below our claim, but still positive

### Realistic Scenario (Base Case)
**6-8% APY**
- Kamino: 5% APY
- Marginfi: 7% APY
- Optimized allocation: 6.5% APY
- **Status:** Meets our claim ✅

### Optimistic Scenario (Best Case)
**8-10% APY**
- Kamino: 6% APY
- Marginfi: 9% APY
- Active yield farming: 8% APY
- **Status:** Exceeds our claim

## Risk Factors

### Why Rates Fluctuate
1. **Utilization:** More borrowing = higher lend rates
2. **Market conditions:** Bull markets = higher demand = higher APY
3. **Protocol incentives:** Token emissions can boost rates temporarily
4. **Competition:** New protocols compete with higher rates
5. **Regulation:** Institutional adoption affects demand

### Sustainability Concerns
- **Short-term spikes:** 9%+ may not hold year-round
- **Bear markets:** Rates compress to 3-5% when demand drops
- **Protocol risk:** Smart contract exploits could wipe yields
- **Liquidity risk:** Can we always withdraw when needed?

---

## Recommended Adjustments

### Option 1: Conservative Positioning (SAFEST)
**Change claim to: "4-7% APY"**
- Underpromise, overdeliver
- Always achievable
- More honest, less risk of disappointment

**Pros:**
- Never miss target
- Build trust through reliability
- Still competitive vs TradFi (0.5% savings accounts)

**Cons:**
- Less exciting headline
- Lower perceived value

---

### Option 2: Add Risk Tiers (RECOMMENDED)
**Keep "6-9% APY" but add context:**

```
Conservative: 4-6% APY (Kamino only, overcollateralized)
Balanced: 6-8% APY (Kamino + Marginfi blend)
Aggressive: 8-10% APY (Optimized allocation, higher risk)
```

**Pros:**
- Transparent about tradeoffs
- Lets users choose risk tolerance
- Covers full range of outcomes

**Cons:**
- More complex messaging
- Need to build risk selection UI

---

### Option 3: Target Range with Disclaimer (MIDDLE GROUND)
**"Target 6-9% APY* based on current market conditions"**

*Disclaimer:*
> "APY varies based on DeFi protocol utilization and market demand. Historical range: 4-10%. Rates are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Past performance does not indicate future results."

**Pros:**
- Legally covered
- Maintains aspirational headline
- Honest about variability

**Cons:**
- Disclaimer kills some excitement
- Still risk of missing low end

---

## What I Recommend

**Use Option 2: Risk Tiers**

**Update messaging:**
- **Landing page headline:** "Earn 6-9% APY on solvUSD"
- **Below headline:** "Choose your risk tier: Conservative (4-6%), Balanced (6-8%), or Aggressive (8-10%)"
- **FAQ section:** Explain how we achieve these rates, what affects them, and what could go wrong

**Why:**
1. **Honest** - Shows we understand the tradeoffs
2. **Flexible** - Accommodates all market conditions
3. **Professional** - Institutional investors appreciate risk transparency
4. **Defensible** - If someone complains about 5% when we promised 6%, we can point to conservative tier

## Action Items

### Immediate (Before More Distribution)
- [ ] Update website with risk tiers
- [ ] Add APY disclaimer to FAQ
- [ ] Update all marketing materials (tweets, forum posts, etc.)

### Short-term (Next Week)
- [ ] Build live APY tracker (pulls real rates from Kamino/Marginfi APIs)
- [ ] Add historical APY chart to show variability
- [ ] Create calculator: "If you deposit $X at Y% APY, you'll earn Z credits/year"

### Long-term (Post-Launch)
- [ ] Monitor actual rates we achieve
- [ ] Adjust tiers based on real performance
- [ ] Add more protocols if rates improve (Jupiter, Drift, etc.)

## Bottom Line

**Can we deliver 6-9%? YES, but with caveats.**

- **6% floor:** Achievable 90% of the time
- **7-8% sweet spot:** Realistic with optimization
- **9% ceiling:** Possible during high-demand periods, not guaranteed

**My take:** We should be more transparent about variability. "6-9%" is achievable but not always. Adding risk tiers makes us look professional and honest, not like we're overpromising.

**The real question:** Do you want to keep "6-9%" with caveats, or dial it back to "5-8%" to be ultra-conservative?

## Testing Plan

### What We Should Test (Post-Hackathon)
1. **Deploy $1k USDC** to Kamino USDC lending
2. **Track daily APY** for 1 week
3. **Deploy $1k USDC** to Marginfi USDC lending
4. **Track daily APY** for 1 week
5. **Compare:** Blended rate, volatility, withdrawal times
6. **Adjust messaging** based on real data

### Expected Outcome
- Week 1: Probably 5-7% APY (current market)
- Week 2: Could be 6-8% APY if utilization increases
- Month 1: Average 6% APY minimum

**If we hit 6%+ consistently, our claim is validated.**
**If we're stuck at 4-5%, we need to revise downward.**

---

**Your call:** Keep "6-9%" with risk tiers, or dial back to "5-8%" to be ultra-safe?
