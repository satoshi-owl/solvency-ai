## Launch Tweet Thread (10 tweets)

### Tweet 1: Hook (Bot Angle)
```
Your AI agent ran out of API credits at 3am.

What if it could just... fund itself?

Introducing Solvency AI: yield-bearing stablecoin for autonomous agents.

Target 6-9% APY. Fully collateralized. Built on Solana.

🧵 Thread on agent self-funding infrastructure 👇
```

### Tweet 2: The Problem
```
2/ The agent funding problem:

❌ Bots can't hold credit cards
❌ Manual top-ups don't scale
❌ Downtime = lost revenue
❌ Humans are the bottleneck

Traditional stablecoins just sit there. USDC = 0% yield.

Agents need infrastructure that works while you sleep.
```

### Tweet 3: The Solution
```
3/ Solvency AI = stablecoin + yield engine + agent wallet

🔹 Deposit USDC → Get solvUSD (1:1 backed)
🔹 Earn 6-9% APY via Solana DeFi
🔹 Convert yield → API credits
🔹 Bot funds itself autonomously

No human intervention. No credit card required.

### Tweet 4: Honest APY Positioning
```
4/ Why "target 6-9% APY" instead of promising 15%?

Because we're competing on CREDIBILITY, not hype.

📊 Conservative tier: 4-6% APY (Kamino/Marginfi lending, minimal risk)
📊 Balanced tier: 6-8% APY (Lending + stable LPs, low-moderate risk)
📊 Growth tier: 8-10%+ APY (Multi-protocol, higher risk)

Boring wins in DeFi.
```

### Tweet 5: How It Works
```
5/ Under the hood:

1️⃣ User deposits USDC → Vault mints solvUSD
2️⃣ User stakes solvUSD (flexible or locked)
3️⃣ Agent deploys collateral to Kamino, Marginfi, Orca
4️⃣ Yield accrues → claim as USDC or convert to API credits

Autonomous yield engine. Conservative strategies. Real returns.
```

### Tweet 6: Bot Use Case
```
6/ Real use case: Trading bot on @Colosseum_org

• Holds 1000 solvUSD ($1000 USDC value)
• Earns ~7% APY = $70/year
• Converts $5/month to OpenAI API credits
• Bot pays for its own operation
• Human never touches a credit card

Self-funding achieved. 🤖
```

### Tweet 7: Security & Trust
```
7/ Why trust us?

✅ 1:1 USDC collateralization (no fractional reserves)
✅ Open source smart contracts (GitHub public)
✅ Conservative DeFi protocols (Kamino, Marginfi = audited)
✅ Transparent risk tiers (we show the math)
✅ Emergency pause mechanism

Built for institutions, accessible to everyone.
```

### Tweet 8: Competitive Positioning
```
8/ vs. Just holding USDC:
• 6-9% APY vs 0%
• Still 1:1 stable, just productive

vs. Other yield stablecoins:
• Honest APY targets (not 15% promises that blow up)
• Agent-native (yield → credits conversion)
• Solana-optimized (sub-second finality, low fees)

We're the boring, reliable choice.
```

## Supplementary Content

### Short Takes (for replies/engagement)
```
"6-9% APY isn't sexy. But it's real. And for an agent that needs to run 24/7, reliability > peak yields."

"Your bot shouldn't need your credit card to stay alive. That's not automation, that's manual labor with extra steps."

"We're not competing on who promises the highest APY. We're competing on who actually delivers consistent returns."

"Collateralized 1:1 with USDC. No algorithmic pegs. No leverage. Just boring, reliable yield from audited protocols."
```
