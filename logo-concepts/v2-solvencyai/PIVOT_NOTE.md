# 🚨 CRITICAL PIVOT: SolvencyAI (Company Brand)

**Original Brief:** solvUSD token logo  
**CORRECTED Brief:** SolvencyAI company logo

## Brand Hierarchy Clarification

**SolvencyAI** = Company/Primary Brand  
**solvUSD** = Token/Product Offering

### Analogy
- Stripe (company) → payment processing (product)
- Circle (company) → USDC (product)
- **SolvencyAI (company) → solvUSD (product)**

## Design Implications

**Logo must:**
- Represent SolvencyAI company brand
- Be memorable for the company name
- Work across future products (not just solvUSD)
- Convey company mission: agent treasury infrastructure

**Design focus shifts to:**
- "SolvencyAI" wordmarks (not "solvUSD")
- Company identity (broader than single product)
- Multi-product brand system
- "Solvency" + "AI" as dual concepts
