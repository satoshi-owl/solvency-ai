# Solvency AI - Brand Guidelines

## Brand Identity

**Tagline:** Yield-bearing stablecoin for self-funding AI agents

**Positioning:** Infrastructure for the autonomous agent economy. Serious DeFi meets practical AI tooling.

## Logo

### Design Concept
A geometric "S" shape that suggests:
- **Flow** - Capital moving through DeFi protocols
- **Circuits** - AI/tech intelligence
- **Stability** - Structured, reliable infrastructure

### Color Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Electric Blue** | `#0EA5E9` | Primary brand color, headings, CTAs |
| **Cyan** | `#06B6D4` | Accent, gradients, highlights |
| **Deep Navy** | `#0F172A` | Background, dark mode base |
| **Slate** | `#1E293B` | Card backgrounds, secondary elements |
| **Light Slate** | `#CBD5E1` | Body text, subtle UI elements |
| **White** | `#F8FAFC` | Primary text on dark backgrounds |

### Logo Files
- `logo.svg` - Vector (scalable, preferred)
- `logo-512.png` - High-res (social media, print)
- `logo-400.png` - Twitter profile size
- `logo-128.png` - Favicons, small UI
- `logo-32.png` - Minimum size test

### Logo Usage
✅ **Do:**
- Use on dark backgrounds (#0F172A or darker)
- Maintain clear space (minimum 20px around logo)
- Scale proportionally
- Use SVG when possible for crisp rendering

❌ **Don't:**
- Distort or stretch
- Change colors (gradient is part of brand identity)
- Use on light backgrounds without adjustment
- Place on busy backgrounds that reduce readability

## Typography

### Headings
- **Font:** System font stack (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto)
- **Weight:** 700 (Bold)
- **Color:** Gradient (Electric Blue → Cyan) for H1, Electric Blue for H2-H3

### Body Text
- **Font:** Same system stack
- **Weight:** 400 (Regular)
- **Color:** Light Slate (#CBD5E1)
- **Line height:** 1.6

### Code/Monospace
- **Font:** 'Courier New', monospace
- **Background:** rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.1)
- **Color:** Cyan (#06B6D4)

## Voice & Tone

**Core Principle:** Infrastructure swagger with casual precision

### Voice Characteristics
1. **Problem-First** - Lead with pain ("Your bot ran out of API credits at 3am"), then relief
2. **Casual Precision** - Technical accuracy, conversational tone ("8-10% APY" not "attractive yield generation mechanisms")
3. **Show, Don't Promise** - Paint pictures, avoid guarantees
4. **Engineering Confidence** - "Yeah, we built that" energy without pretension

### Tone Dials (1-10)
- Serious: 7/10 (real infrastructure, but not boring)
- Funny: 4/10 (wit, not jokes)
- Technical: 6/10 (enough to be credible)
- Hype: 3/10 (excited, not shouty)
- Conversational: 8/10 (bar, not boardroom)

### Example Copy

**YES:**
- "Bots shouldn't need your credit card to stay alive"
- "We're live on Solana devnet. Yield accrues every block. Your agent converts it to API credits. That's it."
- "This is infrastructure for the agent economy that doesn't exist yet"

**NO:**
- "We're thrilled to announce our revolutionary blockchain solution"
- "Leveraging cutting-edge DeFi mechanisms"
- "To the moon! 🚀🚀🚀"

### Forbidden Words/Phrases
- Revolutionary
- Paradigm shift
- Excited to announce
- GM/GN without context
- Overused emojis (🚀💎🙌)
- Crypto tribalism

### Hackathon Pitch (30 sec)
"AI agents need to pay for API calls, but they can't hold credit cards. We built a stablecoin that generates 8-10% APY through DeFi strategies. Bots hold it, earn yield, convert to API credits. Self-funding achieved. We're live on Solana devnet, targeting Colosseum's agent hackathon. Infrastructure for the agent economy that doesn't exist yet."

## Brand Values

1. **Substance over flash** - No generic AI brain imagery, no hype
2. **Technical credibility** - Real infrastructure, not vaporware
3. **Practical utility** - Solves actual problems for developers
4. **Autonomous by design** - Minimal human intervention
5. **Open & transparent** - GitHub public, documentation clear

## Target Audience

### Primary: Solana Developers
- Building AI agents or bots
- Familiar with DeFi concepts
- Value technical precision
- Want practical solutions

### Secondary: DeFi Users
- Understand stablecoins and yield
- Looking for utility beyond speculation
- Interested in emerging use cases

### Tertiary: AI/Agent Builders
- May not know DeFi
- Need tangible benefits (yield = API credits)
- Value automation and self-custody

## Competitive Differentiation

**NOT like:**
- Meme coins (no dog logos, no "to the moon")
- Generic DeFi protocols (we solve agent-specific problems)
- Centralized payment rails (self-custody is core)

**More like:**
- Infrastructure projects (Chainlink, The Graph)
- Developer tools (Helius, Alchemy)
- Serious DeFi (Maker, Aave) but more accessible
