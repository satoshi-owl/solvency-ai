# Solvency Points System - Early Adopter Rewards

**Status:** Planned for post-hackathon launch
**Purpose:** Reward early users, build community, prepare for future $SOLV token

---

## How It Works

### Earning Points

**Deposit & Hold:**
- 1 point per $1 USDC deposited
- 1 point per day per $1 solvUSD held
- Example: Deposit $1000 → hold 30 days = 1,000 + 30,000 = 31,000 points

**Agent Integration:**
- 10,000 points for first agent to integrate
- 5,000 points per subsequent agent integration
- 1,000 points per successful API credit conversion

**Referrals:**
- 20% of referred user's points
- Example: Refer agent that deposits $10k → you get 2,000 points

**Community:**
- 500 points for helpful forum posts
- 1,000 points for bug reports
- 5,000 points for security vulnerability disclosure

## Point Multipliers

**Early Adopter Tiers:**
- First 10 depositors: 3x points
- First 100 depositors: 2x points
- First 1,000 depositors: 1.5x points

**Lockup Bonuses:**
- 30-day commitment: 1.25x
- 90-day commitment: 1.5x
- 180-day commitment: 2x

## Future Redemption (TBD)

**Planned conversion to $SOLV token:**
- Timeline: 6-12 months post-launch
- Conversion rate: TBD based on TVL/revenue
- Governance rights: Yes
- Revenue share: Yes (% of protocol fees)

**Disclaimer:** Points have no current monetary value. Future token is not guaranteed. Conversion rate subject to change.

## Technical Implementation

**Phase 1 (Launch):**
- Track on-chain deposits/holds
- Manual tracking for community contributions
- Display points on dashboard

**Phase 2 (Month 2-3):**
- Automated point accrual
- Referral system
- Leaderboard

**Phase 3 (Month 6-12):**
- $SOLV token design
- Conversion mechanism
- Governance launch

## Messaging

**On website:**
> "Early adopters earn Solvency Points for deposits, holds, and contributions. Points may convert to governance tokens with revenue sharing in the future."

**In docs:**
> "We're building for the long-term. Early users who help us grow will be rewarded when we launch governance."

**On Twitter:**
> "Getting in early has advantages. 👀"

## Why This Works

**For users:**
- Upside potential without speculation
- Encourages longer holds
- Rewards genuine participation

**For us:**
- Build community without token complexity
- Time to figure out tokenomics
- Avoid regulatory issues
- Focus on product now

**For later:**
- Retroactive rewards = fair distribution
- Community ownership earned, not airdropped
- Governance by users who actually used product

**Status: Documented, ready to implement post-hackathon.**
