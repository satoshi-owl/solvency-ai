## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### Color Palette
- **Navy Blue** (#0F2D52) — Institutional authority
- **Gold** (#C9A961) — Luxury, premium
- **White** (#FFFFFF) — Clean, expensive background
- **Charcoal** (#2C3E50) — Professional text

### Typography
- **System fonts** — Instant load, professional
- **Generous spacing** — 80-120px section padding
- **Clear hierarchy** — 56px hero, 40px sections

### Logo
- **Shield/vault symbol** — Security, protection
- **Navy + gold two-tone** — Institutional colors
- **Clean wordmark** — "solv" (bold) + "USD" (light)

## 📊 Research Insights

### What Makes Finance Sites Feel "Expensive"
1. **White backgrounds** (not dark) — Circle, Stripe, Coinbase Institutional
2. **Minimal color palettes** — Navy/blue + gold/brass
3. **Generous whitespace** — 2-3x typical padding
4. **Clean typography** — Professional sans-serif, negative letter-spacing
5. **Conservative messaging** — No hype, honest metrics
6. **Trust signals** — Audits, licenses, transparency

### Applied Patterns from
- **Circle.com** — Regulatory emphasis, white background, institutional language
- **Stripe.com** — Generous whitespace, enterprise messaging, big credible numbers
- **High-end banks** — Navy + gold colors, shield symbolism, professional restraint
