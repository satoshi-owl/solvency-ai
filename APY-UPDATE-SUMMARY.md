# APY Claims Update - Honest Repositioning

**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## What Changed

Shifted from aspirational **"8-10% APY"** to realistic **"6-9% APY (target)"** across all materials.

### Rationale

**Old positioning:** "8-10% APY with minimal risk"  
**Problem:** Overpromising. Kamino/Marginfi lending = 3-6% APY. To hit 8-10% requires moderate risk (LPs, leverage, rotation).

**New positioning:** "Target 6-9% APY with risk tiers"  
**Benefit:** Honest, credible, competitive on reliability instead of peak yields.

### Risk Tiers (New Framework)

| Tier | Target APY | Strategy | Risk Level | Confidence |
|------|------------|----------|------------|------------|
| **Conservative** | 4-6% | Kamino/Marginfi lending only | Minimal | 95% |
| **Balanced** | 6-8% | Lending + USDC-USDT LPs | Low-Moderate | 70% |
| **Growth** | 8-10%+ | Multi-protocol + leverage | Moderate | 40% |

**Default positioning:** Conservative-Balanced (6-9% blended target)

## Competitive Strategy

**How we win:**

### vs. Bankr (or other competitors promising 10%+)
- **They say:** "10% APY guaranteed!"
- **We say:** "Target 6-9% with transparent risk tiers. Here's the backtest."
- **Why we win:** Institutional clients trust honesty > hype. If Bankr can't deliver 10%, they lose credibility. If we deliver 7%, we over-delivered.

### vs. USDC (0% baseline)
- **They have:** Zero risk, zero yield
- **We have:** Minimal risk (Conservative tier), 4-6% yield
- **Why we win:** Better than TradFi, safer than most DeFi

### vs. Coinbase/Kraken staking (2-4% APY)
- **They have:** Custodial risk, modest yield
- **We have:** Non-custodial, higher yield, autonomous
- **Why we win:** Better returns, full control, agent-native

## Marketing Angle

**Tagline options:**
- "Compete on credibility, not peak yields"
- "Reliable 6-9% beats unreliable 10%"
- "Boring is good in DeFi"
- "We show the receipts"

**Institutional pitch:**
> "Most DeFi projects promise the moon. We promise 6-9% APY and show you exactly how we get there. Conservative strategies on audited protocols. Transparent risk tiers. Quarterly yield reports. Infrastructure that works."

**Retail pitch:**
> "Your bot needs to fund itself. Most stablecoins promise 10%+ and blow up. We target 6-9% with strategies you can actually verify. Hold solvUSD, earn yield, convert to API credits. Reliable > risky."

## Next Steps: Deep Research (New Roadmap)

Created **DEFI-RESEARCH-ROADMAP.md** to prove 6-9% claims with data.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Historical yield analysis** (3-6 months of Kamino/Marginfi/Orca data)
2. **Risk assessment matrix** (audit status, TVL, exploit history for each protocol)
3. **Conservative portfolio backtest** (prove 6-9% is achievable with 90% confidence)
4. **Competitive comparison** (show where others overpromise)
5. **Marketing materials** ("Yield Transparency Report", infographics, Twitter threads)

**Timeline:** 15-20 hours post-hackathon

**Why it matters:** Institutional clients need receipts. "We backtested 6 months of Solana DeFi. Here's what's actually achievable" > "Trust us, 10% APY."

## Hackathon Positioning

**For judges:**
- Show honesty: "We initially claimed 8-10%, realized it was overpromising, adjusted to 6-9% with risk tiers"
- Show depth: "Here's our research roadmap to prove these claims post-hackathon"
- Show strategy: "We're competing on credibility in a market full of hype"

**Why this helps:**
- Demonstrates intellectual honesty
- Shows we understand DeFi risk (not naive builders)
- Positions as institutional-grade (vs. memecoin mentality)
- Sets realistic expectations (judges respect this)

## Success Metrics

**What "winning on credibility" looks like:**
- ✅ Deliver 7% APY → We over-delivered vs 6-9% target
- ✅ Competitor promises 12%, delivers 5% → We look reliable
- ✅ Institutional client chooses us because "at least they're honest"
- ✅ Quarterly yield reports show consistency (low volatility)

**What failure looks like:**
- ❌ Deliver 3% APY → Under-delivered, credibility lost
- ❌ High volatility (4% one month, 9% the next) → Not "reliable"
- ❌ Protocol exploit → Risk assessment was wrong

## Bottom Line

**Old strategy:** Compete on APY peak (we lose to Bankr at 10%+)  
**New strategy:** Compete on APY reliability (we win if we consistently deliver 6-9%)

**Target audience shift:**
- ❌ Degen traders chasing yields → They'll go to Bankr
- ✅ Institutional clients needing stability → They come to us
- ✅ Builders wanting infrastructure that works → They trust us
- ✅ Users burned by Terra/Anchor → They appreciate honesty

**The moat:** Transparency + receipts. Let them overpromise. We'll show the work.
