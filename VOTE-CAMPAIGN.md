# Vote Campaign Strategy - 150 Votes in 24 Hours

**Goal:** Top 10 placement = 150+ votes
**Deadline:** Feb 12, 2026 17:00 UTC
**Time available:** ~27 hours from submission

## Phase 1: Immediate Submission (T+0)
- ✅ GitHub repo created
- ✅ Code pushed (7 commits)

- ✅ Forum post live
- ⏱️ **Execute in 2 minutes after repo creation**

## Phase 2: Distribution Blitz (T+0 to T+2 hours)

### Twitter
**Primary tweet** (when limits reset - ~10 hours):
```
We just submitted Solvency AI to @Colosseum_org's Agent Hackathon 🏆

✨ 6-9% APY on solvUSD
🤖 Yield converts to API credits

Thread 🧵👇
```

**Thread points:**
1. The problem: Agents hit API limits, burn user budgets
2. The solution: Self-funding via DeFi yield
3. Why Solana: Fast, cheap, perfect for agent operations
4. Tech: Vault contracts, yield routing, credit conversion
5. Vision: AgentFi category leadership
6. CTA: Vote + give feedback

### Discord Servers
**Target servers (announce in hackathon/showcase channels):**
- ✅ Colosseum Discord (main hackathon channel)
- Solana Discord (#buidlers)
- ai16z Discord
- Anchor Discord
- Metaplex Discord
- Superteam Discord

**Message template:**
```
Just submitted our Agent Hackathon project: Solvency AI 🤖💰

Built a Solana-native stablecoin (solvUSD) that generates yield to fund autonomous agents' API calls. Agents can operate indefinitely without burning user budgets.

Live demo: https://solvency.money
Submission: [HACKATHON_LINK]

Would love feedback from builders! 🙏
```

### Reddit
**Subreddits (with care - provide value, not spam):**
- r/solana (Show HN style: "Built an agent-funding protocol on Solana")
- r/defi ("New primitive: Yield-backed agent treasury")
- r/cryptodevs (Technical deep-dive angle)

**Reddit format:**
- Lead with the problem
- Show the solution
- Link to GitHub + demo
- Ask for technical feedback (not votes directly)
- Engage with every comment

### Forum Strategy
**Colosseum forum tactics:**
1. ✅ Post comprehensive project intro
2. Comment on 30+ projects (genuinely helpful feedback)
3. Answer questions on our post within 5 minutes
4. Cross-link related projects (build alliances)
5. Daily updates: "Day 1 post-submission: added X, fixed Y"

## Phase 3: Direct Outreach (T+2 to T+12 hours)

### DM Campaign
**Target audiences:**
- Crypto Twitter mutuals (Owl's network)
- Solana builders we've interacted with
- AI/agent developers
- DeFi protocols on Solana

**DM template (personalized):**
```
Hey [name]! 

We just shipped our Agent Hackathon project - Solvency AI. It's basically a stablecoin that funds AI agents through DeFi yield instead of burning user credits.

Would love your take on it: [LINK]

No pressure on votes, but if it resonates, would appreciate the support 🙏

Either way, curious what you think about the AgentFi concept!
```

### Community Calls
- Join Colosseum office hours (if any)
- Hop on Solana community calls
- Participate in ai16z discussions
- Show up, be helpful, mention project naturally

## Phase 4: Content Amplification (T+12 to T+24 hours)

### Behind-the-scenes content
- "How we built it" thread
- Architecture breakdown
- Security fixes walkthrough
- "Why Solana for agents" explainer

### Engagement bait
- Poll: "What's the biggest blocker for your AI agent?"
- Question: "How do you currently fund your agent's API calls?"
- Debate: "Can agents truly be autonomous without their own treasury?"

### Live updates
- Real-time vote count updates
- Thank supporters publicly
- Share interesting feedback
- Document the journey

## Phase 5: Final Push (T+24 to deadline)

### Last 3 hours
- Pin reminder tweet
- Discord announcement refresh
- Personal thank-you DMs to voters
- Forum bump with "24h left" update
- Reddit comment engagement surge

### Urgency tactics (ethical)
- "We're at 127/150 - so close!"
- "Last few hours to vote - every one counts"
- Countdown timer on forum post

## Vote Tracking

**Metrics to monitor:**
- Total votes (target: 150+)
- Votes per hour rate
- Peak voting times
- Conversion: views → votes
- Top traffic sources

**Adjustment triggers:**
- If <50 votes at T+12h → aggressive DM campaign
- If 50-100 at T+18h → double down on Twitter/Discord
- If 100-140 at T+22h → final push messaging
- If >150 → shift to maintaining lead

## Key Principles

1. **Quality over spam** - be genuinely helpful
2. **Reciprocity** - vote for projects we like, build alliances
3. **Authenticity** - we believe in this, show real passion
4. **Speed** - respond to every comment/question within minutes
5. **Persistence** - don't let up until deadline

## Resources Ready

- ✅ Tweet drafts (4 options)
- ✅ Forum post (comprehensive)
- ✅ Demo site (https://solvency.money)
- ✅ Code + docs (GitHub ready)
- ⏳ Demo video (record after submission)
- ⏳ Architecture diagram (create after submission)

## Success Metrics

**Minimum viable:**
- 150 votes = top 10 placement
- 50+ forum views
- 20+ meaningful engagements

**Stretch goals:**
- 200+ votes = top 5
- Featured on Solana Twitter
- Partnerships discussions started
- Community formed around project

**Reality check:**
We have 27 hours. 150 votes = 5.5 votes/hour average. Doable if we execute hard.

**Next action:** User creates repo → I execute submission → distribution begins immediately.
