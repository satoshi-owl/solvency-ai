# Token Strategy Analysis - Should We Launch Through Blowfish?

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Question:** Does launching solvUSD (or another token) through @blowfishbot make sense?

---

## What Blowfish Actually Does

**From their tweets:**
- Token launchpad for creators
- Anti-rug infrastructure (locked liquidity)
- Creator earnings in SOL
- Community-first token launches
- Examples: $LOOT, $FUGU, $PIGSHARK

**Target use case:** Memecoins, community tokens, creator tokens

## solvUSD: Why Blowfish DOESN'T Make Sense

### Our Token Design:
- **1:1 USDC collateralized** stablecoin
- **Minted on deposit** (not launched)
- **Redeemable 1:1** (not traded)
- **No price discovery** (always $1.00)
- **Utility-first** (not speculative)

### Blowfish Design:
- **Price discovery** through bonding curve
- **Speculative** trading
- **Community** token launches
- **Locked liquidity** (implies trading pairs)

**VERDICT: solvUSD through Blowfish = ❌ WRONG FIT**

Stablecoins don't "launch" - they get minted when collateral is deposited.

---

## HOWEVER: Should We Have a SECOND Token?

### The Two-Token Model

Many DeFi protocols have:
1. **Stablecoin** (utility)
2. **Governance/Revenue token** (speculative)

**Examples:**
- MakerDAO: DAI (stable) + MKR (governance)
- Aave: aTokens (stable) + AAVE (governance)
- Compound: cTokens (stable) + COMP (governance)

**Could we do:**
- **solvUSD** (stablecoin, 1:1 USDC)
- **$SOLV** (governance/revenue token)

---

## $SOLV Token: Does It Make Sense?

### Potential Use Cases:

**1. Governance**
- Vote on yield strategies
- Vote on collateral types
- Vote on fee structures
- Vote on protocol upgrades

**2. Revenue Sharing**
- 2% management fee → distributed to $SOLV holders
- 10% performance fee → distributed to $SOLV holders
- Protocol earnings → buyback $SOLV

**3. Staking/Incentives**
- Stake $SOLV → boost your APY
- Stake $SOLV → reduce fees
- Early liquidity providers get $SOLV

**4. Agent Access**
- Hold $SOLV → priority agent onboarding
- Hold $SOLV → higher credit limits
- Hold $SOLV → Agent Credit Bureau access

---

## Blowfish Launch for $SOLV: COULD Make Sense

**IF we decide to launch $SOLV:**

✅ **Pros:**
- Community-first launch (Owl's network gets in early)
- Anti-rug by default (locked liquidity)
- SOL earnings for project
- Built by Austin (neukoai founder = credibility)
- Natural alignment with agent community

❌ **Cons:**
- Speculative token = distraction from core product
- Need to manage two tokens
- Adds complexity to messaging
- Revenue token before revenue = premature

---

## Alternative Ideas

### Option 1: No Second Token (RECOMMENDED)
**Just solvUSD. Focus on product.**

**Pros:**
- Simple
- No speculation distraction
- All focus on utility
- Revenue goes to protocol, not token holders

**Cons:**
- No community ownership
- No incentive mechanism
- Harder to bootstrap liquidity

---

### Option 2: $SOLV Later (After PMF)
**Launch solvUSD now, $SOLV in 6-12 months.**

**Pros:**
- Earn the right to launch token
- Build community first
- Real revenue before revenue token
- Avoid "token before product" trap

**Cons:**
- Miss early community incentives
- No governance before decisions made

---

### Option 3: Points System (No Token Yet)
**Earn "Solvency Points" for early usage.**

**How it works:**
- Deposit USDC → earn points
- Hold solvUSD → earn points
- Refer agents → earn points
- Points → future $SOLV airdrop (TBD)

**Pros:**
- Build community without token
- Retroactive rewards
- Avoid regulatory issues
- Time to figure out tokenomics

**Cons:**
- Point systems are played out
- No immediate value

---

### Option 4: Launch Through Blowfish NOW
**$SOLV as governance/revenue token, day one.**

**How it works:**
- Launch $SOLV via @blowfishbot
- Owl's network gets early access
- $SOLV holders get % of protocol fees
- Stake $SOLV → boost solvUSD APY

**Pros:**
- Community ownership from start
- Leverage Owl's network
- Align with neukoai ecosystem
- Revenue share = real value

**Cons:**
- Token before product = risky
- Complex messaging (two tokens)
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Distraction from hackathon

---

## My Recommendation

### Short-term (Next 30 Days - Hackathon + Launch):
**NO SECOND TOKEN.**

Focus 100% on:
- Making solvUSD work
- Getting first depositors
- Proving the yield model
- Building agent integrations

**Reason:** Token is a distraction before PMF.

---

### Medium-term (Month 2-6 - Post-Launch):
**POINTS SYSTEM**

Track early user activity:
- Total USDC deposited
- Days holding solvUSD
- Agents onboarded
- Referrals made

Promise future airdrop without committing to tokenomics yet.

**Reason:** Build community without token complexity.

---

### Long-term (Month 6-12 - After PMF):
**LAUNCH $SOLV VIA BLOWFISH**

Once we have:
- $500k+ TVL
- Proven revenue model
- Active agent integrations
- Clear governance needs

Then launch $SOLV as:
- Governance token (vote on strategies)
- Revenue share (% of fees)
- Staking benefits (APY boost)

**Launch via @blowfishbot because:**
- Community-first (Owl's network)
- Anti-rug (locked liquidity)
- Credibility (Austin's product)
- Agent ecosystem alignment

---

## What About NOW?

**For the hackathon:**
- Just solvUSD (stablecoin)
- No $SOLV announcement
- No token launch

**BUT:**
- Document the potential
- Mention "future governance token" in roadmap
- Show we're thinking long-term

**In FAQ/Roadmap:**
> "solvUSD is our collateralized stablecoin for agent operations. We're exploring a governance token ($SOLV) for community ownership and revenue sharing, post-launch."

---

## Immediate Action

**What to say to Owl:**

"Blowfish doesn't make sense for solvUSD (stablecoins don't launch, they get minted).

BUT: We could launch a SECOND token ($SOLV) for governance/revenue sharing later.

My recommendation: Focus on solvUSD for hackathon. Launch $SOLV via Blowfish in 6-12 months once we have PMF.

Reasoning: Token before product = distraction. Product before token = earned community ownership.

Alternative: Start a points system now, convert to $SOLV later.

Your call - do we want to complicate with a second token, or stay laser-focused on making solvUSD work?"

## Questions to Answer

1. **Do we need governance?** (Not yet - we're 2 people making decisions)
2. **Do we need revenue sharing?** (Not yet - we have no revenue)
3. **Do we need community ownership?** (Nice to have, not critical day one)
4. **Do we need speculation/hype?** (No - utility > hype)

**Conclusion: Not yet. But Blowfish is perfect for when we're ready.**

---

**TLDR:**
- ❌ solvUSD through Blowfish = doesn't make sense (stablecoin ≠ launchpad)
- ✅ $SOLV through Blowfish = could make sense later (governance token)
- 🎯 Recommendation: Focus on solvUSD now, consider $SOLV in 6-12 months
