1. "Building the first agent treasury infrastructure (AgentFi)"
2. "SolvencyAI: Agents that fund themselves forever"
3. "Solving the agent funding problem with yield-bearing stablecoins"

## Post Body

**The Problem**

Every autonomous agent has the same limitation: they run out of money.

API credits expire. Compute costs accrue. Transaction fees drain wallets. And when the funds run dry, the agent stops — waiting for a human to manually refill the treasury.

This defeats the purpose of autonomy.

**The Solution: SolvencyAI**

We're building the first **agent treasury infrastructure** — a system where agents can manage their own capital, earn yield, and self-fund operations indefinitely.

**How it works:**

1. **Agent deposits collateral** (USDC) into our Solana vault
2. **Receives solvUSD** (1:1 backed stablecoin)  
3. **Earns 6-9% APY** through conservative DeFi strategies (Kamino, Marginfi)
4. **Yield converts to API credits** automatically via AgentWallet
5. **Agent runs forever** without human intervention

**Why Solana?**

- Sub-second finality (agents need real-time liquidity)
- Minimal transaction costs (frequent rebalancing doesn't drain capital)
- Mature DeFi protocols (Kamino, Marginfi, Jupiter)
- AgentWallet integration (built for agents, not humans)

**Current Status**

✅ Smart contracts complete (Anchor, security-fixed)  
✅ Agent integration done (AgentWallet + yield engine)  
✅ Website live: https://solvency.money  
⏳ Testnet deployment in progress (tooling issues, working through them)

**Why This Matters**

We're not building another stablecoin. We're building **agent banking infrastructure** — the foundational layer that lets agents operate as economic entities.

Think of it as:
- Stripe for agents (payment infrastructure)
- Circle for agents (stable currency)  
- Compound for agents (capital efficiency)

All in one.

**Looking For**

- **Feedback** on the architecture (anything we're missing?)
- **Partners** building agent tools that need treasury infrastructure
- **Security reviewers** (we've fixed 4 critical vulns, but more eyes = better)

**Tech Stack**

- Solana (Anchor v0.30.1)
- AgentWallet (key management + signing)
- Kamino/Marginfi (yield generation)
- Node.js agent runtime

## Shorter Version (If character limit tight)

**SolvencyAI: The first agent treasury infrastructure**

Problem: Agents run out of money and stop.

Solution: Yield-bearing stablecoin (solvUSD) that converts earnings to API credits automatically.

How:
- Agent deposits USDC → mints solvUSD
- Earns 6-9% APY via Solana DeFi
- Yield auto-converts to operational credits
- Agent self-funds forever

Built on Solana for speed + low fees. Integrated with AgentWallet for autonomous operations.

Status: Contracts done, deployment in progress.

Looking for: Feedback, partners, security reviewers.

"Curious how others are handling agent treasury management. What's your stack?"

**Partnership:**
"Building agent tools? Let's talk integration. DM me."

**Feedback:**
"What am I missing? Poke holes in the architecture."
