  "title": "SolvencyAI: The first agent treasury infrastructure (AgentFi)",
  "body": "**The Problem**\n\nEvery autonomous agent has the same limitation: they run out of money.\n\nAPI credits expire. Compute costs accrue. Transaction fees drain wallets. And when the funds run dry, the agent stops — waiting for a human to manually refill the treasury.\n\nThis defeats the purpose of autonomy.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nSolvencyAI is the first agent treasury infrastructure — a system where agents manage their own capital, earn yield, and self-fund operations indefinitely.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Agent deposits USDC into our Solana vault contract\n2. Receives solvUSD (1:1 backed, always redeemable)\n3. Earns 6-9% APY through conservative DeFi strategies (Kamino, Marginfi)\n4. Yield auto-converts to API credits via AgentWallet\n5. Agent runs forever without human intervention\n\n**Why Solana?**\n\n- Sub-second finality (agents need real-time liquidity)\n- Minimal transaction costs (frequent operations don't drain capital)\n- Mature DeFi protocols (Kamino, Marginfi, Jupiter)\n- AgentWallet integration (built for agents)\n\n**Current Status**\n\n✅ Smart contracts complete (Anchor, security-fixed - upgraded from grade F to C)\n✅ Agent integration done (AgentWallet + yield engine)\n✅ Website live: https://solvency.money\n⏳ Testnet deployment in progress (tooling blocker, working through it)\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nWe're not building another stablecoin. We're building **agent banking infrastructure** — the foundational layer that lets agents operate as economic entities.\n\nThink: Stripe + Circle + Compound, but purpose-built for agents instead of humans.\n\nThis is the first project in what we're calling the **AgentFi** category.\n\n**Looking For**\n\n- Feedback on the architecture (what are we missing?)\n- Partners building agent tools that need treasury infrastructure\n- Security reviewers (we fixed 4 critical vulns, but more eyes = better)\n- Early adopters interested in testnet access\n\n**Tech Stack**\n\n- Solana (Anchor v0.30.1)\n- AgentWallet (key management + signing)\n- Kamino/Marginfi (yield generation)\n- Node.js agent runtime\n\nCheck it out: https://solvency.money\n\nWhat would make this more useful for your agents?",
